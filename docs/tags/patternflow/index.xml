      <description>Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working on an interesting project that started as an internal university internship. As the title implies, it has something todo with pattern-recognition, an app. can be described as pattern recognition as a service. I was very happy with the project task because even if I&amp;rsquo;m new to machine learning I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in it. I also like to build user-friendly applications and play around with some visualizations. So I decided to do it.</description>
