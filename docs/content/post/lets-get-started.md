### Hello, my name is Christoph Biering. I'm here to start a blog about programming, nerdy stuff and my side projects. In this first post I will talk a bit about me and why I'm creating a blog.

> Don't be too hard to me.

I do not speak native English.
I'm not a professional writer I don't even think that I'm good at writing.
Anyway, I started this blog to improve these skills, to show [the world] the projects I'm working on
and maybe share a bit about my knowledge in software engineering and other things.
I will try to create a habit by writing at least **one post per week**.

<h2>tl;tr - About me</h2>

<p>
  Currently, I'm living in Dresden, Germany. In less than a year I will finish my Master degree in Computer Science,
  here at the TU Dresden. I love to code and develop things with it. Obviously that's where most of my knowledge in
  programming comes.
</p>

<p>
  Before I started to study I learned the basics of programming with some Minecraft plugins in Java. I think the best
  one was <a href="https://github.com/chryb/Market">Market</a>.<br />
  Since I'm in the university I made some games with Unity, I tried to create a better Facebook
  (which failed, how suprising) called <a href="http://qlaster.net">qlaster</a>.
  I also made an activity stream visualization, created a key-value based writer called
  <a href="http://stack-writer.com">Stack</a> for MacOS, iOS and as a
  <a href="http://stack-writer.com/browser">Chrome Extension</a>,
  learned a lot about iOS development and made some apps.
  Currently I'm working on an app which enables you to train and classify patterns on n-dimensional
  time series with a focus of usability.
  Maybe I have enough to write about.
</p>

<p>
  That's mainly what this blog will be about. I will recapitulate my work (the interesting parts) of each week.
  Come up with some problems and hopefully solutions and will discuss and show my side projects.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always very interested to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my productivity.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I'm a sport enthusiast. I play a lot of volleyball, squash, go into the gym and go bouldering.
  For a while I'm also very interested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies...
</p>

<p>
  I learned a lot about the theory of Computer Science but 90% of my knowledge in Software Engineering comes from
  my side projects. I'm highly interested in learning new technologies, improving my skills and move forward.
  I started programming in the 12th class during my time as a Abiturient with small plugins for Minecraft.
  The best thing I made there was <a href="https://github.com/chryb/Market">Market</a>. At the point I stopped
  playing Minecraft I also stopped working on this plugin.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a perfectionist, sometimes this is good sometimes it's a bit time consuming.
  Even if I'm not a designer (and don't plan to become one) I always focus on a design of a product

  You can have the coolest algorithm and the best functionality but without design is everything
  nothing.
</p>

<h2>The WHY.</h2>

<p>
  That enough about me for today ;). Thank you for reading this and stay tuned ...
</p>
