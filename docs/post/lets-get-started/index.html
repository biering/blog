I&rsquo;m here to start a blog about programming, nerdy stuff and my side projects. In this first post I will talk a bit about me and why I&rsquo;m creating a blog.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too hard to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not speak native English.
I&rsquo;m not a professional writer I don&rsquo;t even think that I&rsquo;m good at writing.
Anyway, I started this blog to improve these skills, to show [the world] the projects I&rsquo;m working on
and maybe share a bit about my knowledge in software engineering and other things.
I will try to create a habit by writing at least <strong>one post per week</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="tl-tr-about-me">tl; tr - About me</h2>

<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m living in Dresden, Germany. In less than a year I will finish my Master degree in Computer Science,
here at the TU Dresden. I love to code and develop things with it. Obviously that&rsquo;s where most of my knowledge in
programming comes.</p>

<p>Before I started to study I learned the basics of programming with some Minecraft plugins in Java. I think the best
one was <a href="https://github.com/chryb/Market">Market</a>.
Since I&rsquo;m in the university I made some games with Unity, I tried to create a better Facebook
(which failed, how suprising) called <a href="http://qlaster.net">qlaster</a>.
I also made an activity stream visualization, created a key-value based writer called
<a href="http://stack-writer.com">Stack</a> for MacOS, iOS and as a
<a href="http://stack-writer.com/browser">Chrome Extension</a>,
learned a lot about iOS development and made some apps.
Currently I&rsquo;m working on an app which enables you to train and classify patterns on n-dimensional
time series with a focus of usability.
Maybe I have enough to write about.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s mainly what this blog will be about. I will recapitulate my work (the interesting parts) of each week.
Come up with some problems and hopefully solutions and will discuss and show my side projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always very interested to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my productivity.</p>

<p>In my spare time I&rsquo;m a sport enthusiast. I play a lot of volleyball, squash, go into the gym and go bouldering.
For a while I&rsquo;m also very interested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perfectionist, sometimes this is good sometimes it&rsquo;s a bit time consuming.
Even if I&rsquo;m not a designer (and don&rsquo;t plan to become one) I always focus on a design of a product</p>

<p>You can have the coolest algorithm and the best functionality but without design is everything
nothing.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The WHY</h2>

<p>That enough about me for today ;). Thank you for reading this and stay tuned &hellip;</p>
