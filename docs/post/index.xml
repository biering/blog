      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m curious about the prices for some markdown editors at the app store. So I made my own one (and because I have the core from my previous project Stack). If you look some projects on the app store for example
They are good, no question

      <description>Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working on an interesting project that started as an internal university internship. Basically, it can be described as pattern recognition as a service. I was very happy with the project task because even if I&amp;rsquo;m new to machine learning I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in it. I also like to build user-friendly applications and play around with some visualizations. So I decided to do it.
Background Before we go further, here are some definitions to be sure we have the same ideas in mind.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Christoph Biering. I&amp;rsquo;m here to start a blog about programming, nerdy stuff and my side projects. But first of all, I will write a bit about me and why I&amp;rsquo;m creating a blog.  Don&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to me.
 I&amp;rsquo;m not a native English speaker. I&amp;rsquo;m not a professional writer nor a person of many words and I don&amp;rsquo;t even think that I&amp;rsquo;m good at writing at all.</description>
