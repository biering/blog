### Hello, my name is Christoph Biering. I'm here to start a blog about programming, nerdy stuff and my side projects. In this first post I will talk a bit about me and why I'm creating a blog.

> Don't be too hard to me.

I do not speak native English.
I'm not a professional writer I don't even think that I'm good at writing.
Anyway, I started this blog to improve these skills, to show [the world] the projects I'm working on
and maybe share a bit about my knowledge in software engineering and other things.
I will try to create a habit by writing at least **one post per week**.

## tl; tr - About me

Currently, I'm living in Dresden, Germany. In less than a year I will finish my Master degree in Computer Science,
here at the TU Dresden. I love to code and develop things with it. Obviously that's where most of my knowledge in
programming comes.

Before I started to study I learned the basics of programming with some Minecraft plugins in Java. I think the best
one was [Market](https://github.com/chryb/Market).
Since I'm in the university I made some games with Unity, I tried to create a better Facebook
(which failed, how suprising) called [qlaster](http://qlaster.net).
I also made an activity stream visualization, created a key-value based writer called
[Stack](http://stack-writer.com) for MacOS, iOS and as a
[Chrome Extension](http://stack-writer.com/browser),
learned a lot about iOS development and made some apps.
Currently I'm working on an app which enables you to train and classify patterns on n-dimensional
time series with a focus of usability.
Maybe I have enough to write about.


That's mainly what this blog will be about. I will recapitulate my work (the interesting parts) of each week.
Come up with some problems and hopefully solutions and will discuss and show my side projects.

I'm always very interested to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my productivity.

In my spare time I'm a sport enthusiast. I play a lot of volleyball, squash, go into the gym and go bouldering.
For a while I'm also very interested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies...

I'm a perfectionist, sometimes this is good sometimes it's a bit time consuming.
Even if I'm not a designer (and don't plan to become one) I always focus on a design of a product

You can have the coolest algorithm and the best functionality but without design is everything
nothing.

## The WHY

That enough about me for today ;). Thank you for reading this and stay tuned ...
