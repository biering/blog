### Hello, my name is Christoph Biering. I'm here to start a blog about programming, nerdy stuff and my side projects. But first of all, I will write a bit about me and why I'm creating a blog.

> Don't be too hard to me.

I do not speak native English.
I'm not a professional writer, I'm not a person of many words and I don't even think that I'm good at writing.
Anyway, I started this blog to improve these skills, to show [the world] the projects I'm working on
and maybe share a bit about my knowledge in software engineering and other things.

Recently I come to the conclusion that habits are very useful to stay motivated and to get shit done, thank you [mpj] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5FYpwZMXU).
That's the reason I want to create a habit by writing at least **one post per week**.

## tl;tr - About me

Currently, I'm living in Dresden, Germany. In less than a year I will finish my Master degree in Computer Science,
here at the TU Dresden. I love to code and work on my side projects. Obviously, that's where most of my knowledge in
programming comes.

I'm always very interested to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my productivity. My list named "things I should learn" is constantly growing. Recently, I'm in passion with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to build applications for Web and Desktop.
I'm always trying to focus and the code and design, because even if I primarily interested in software engineering, in my opinion, an application is not ready before it doesn't look good.

Before I started to study I learned the basics of programming with some Minecraft plugins in Java. I think the best
one was [Market](https://github.com/chryb/Market).
Since I'm at the university I made some games with Unity, I tried to create a better Facebook
(which failed, how surprising) called [qlaster](http://qlaster.net).
I also made an activity stream visualization, created a key-value based writer called
[Stack](http://stack-writer.com) for MacOS, iOS and as a [Chrome Extension](http://stack-writer.com/browser).
I'm learned a lot about iOS development and made some apps for example [Zeit](http://chryb.me/zeit).
Currently, I'm working on an app which enables you to train and classify patterns on n-dimensional
time series with a focus on usability.
Maybe I have enough to write about.

That's mainly what this blog will be about. I will recapitulate my work (the interesting parts) of each week.
Come up with some problems and hopefully solutions and will discuss and show my side projects.

That enough about me for today ;). Thank you for reading this and stay tuned for future posts.
