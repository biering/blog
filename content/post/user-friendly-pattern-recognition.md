### Currently, I'm working on an interesting project based on a university course. It should answer the question if it is possible to combine a good user experience with pattern recognition on n-dimensional time series.


## Background

Before I start with the project I want to write a bit about the definitions.

## Problems

lala test

- select n-dim data
- import data / smooth / simplify data
- visualization
- algo selection
